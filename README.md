# Apache Solr for TYPO3 CMS - Addon: More Like This

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TYPO3-Solr/ext-solrmlt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TYPO3-Solr/ext-solrmlt)

"More Like This" allows to take a single result document as the basis for another query retrieving in similar results. A frontend plugin shall be provided to display links to similar pages like the one the visitor is currently viewing.

Status: Still missing more configurations options via typoscript.
